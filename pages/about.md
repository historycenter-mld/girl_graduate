## About the Girl Graduate Scrapbook
Ardath Caldwell's scrapbook contains a rare insight into the life of a Meridian High School teen in the early 1920's. Raised in a middle-to-upper class family in 1922, her life wasn't that different from today's typical teenager - with the exception of modern technology! She enjoyed parties, socializing with friends, school dances and other activities. The scrapbook documents various milestones in her life and gives us a glimpse into her time at Meridian High School.

## The Class of 1922
The Meridian History Center has many of the original Meridian High School yearbooks dating from 1921. According to the 1922 <i>Mana Ha Sa</i> yearbook, the class of 1922 started with 53 freshman and graduated 36 students. This was an accomplishment at a time when children frequently dropped out of school to assist with farm work or family care. 

The yearbook's dedication is as follows:<br><i>To our parents and to all<br>Who have made possible<br>The Meridian High School<br>We dedicate the second volume of the<br>Mana Ha Sa</i>

Ardath Caldwell participated in several class plays, as depicted in the scrapbook. The yearbook's "class prophecy" predicted she would become a famous actress. The "class will" for Ardath reads: <i>Ardath Caldwell, the future city "dadess" leaves her council capacity to "Chuck" Morford.</i>

What became of Ardath Caldwell is unknown. We would love to know if she was able to fulfill her dream of becomming an actress! Anyone who has information is welcome to contact us so we can update our records.
